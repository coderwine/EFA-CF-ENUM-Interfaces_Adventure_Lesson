# The Adventurer - ENUMs & INTERFACES Lesson

## Lesson Setup

Project folder name: **ENUM-Interfaces_Adventurer**

**Instructor Notes**
- **START** in ```StartLesson.md``` - within the **src folder**.
- **TEST Folder**: This is strictly for the lesson build, not for this actual lesson.
  - Testing lesson will include these base builds, but will be a separate repo that the students will pull down and take notes.

**Creating a GitHub Repo**

Don't forget to backup your project. After framing it out, this would be a good point to initialize it.
```
git init
git add
git commit -m "Framed Project"
```

## CHALLENGES

These are also at the bottom of ```Program_UI.cs```

- Add an option to View a Single Adventurer. **done**
- Consider selecting an existing item in character creation instead of starting at creating an item. **done**
- Include a View all Items option. **done**
- Include a View Item by ID option. 
- Update the Adventurer Pack to add items from an the item list instead of currently the whole list.
    - Consider if there are more than one adventurer and they pull from the same item list.
    - What about removing items from the adventurers pack?

Don't limit to what these suggest. If you have something that you'd like to try out, go for it!
